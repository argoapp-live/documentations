## 2. Staking

To stake in The **ARGO** Pool, you must have **$ARGO** tokens. You can get **$ARGO** tokens by trading on, ARGO-ETH UNI LP token ARGO-MATIC DFYN LP Token <br/><br/>

When you deposit assets to the ArGo liquidity pool and stake your tokenized pool shares, you are eligible to earn both trading fees (mainnet) and staking rewards. This is because as a liquidity provider, you face asset risk (by supplying your tokens to the pool) and volatility risk (because price swings can lead to impermanent loss). In exchange for this “work”, you are rewarded with:

<b>1.</b> Trading fees e.g. Uniswap V2 offers a 0.03% fee to anyone who supplies liquidity to a token pair. <br/>
<b>2.</b> Staking rewards in the form of ARGO tokens. <br/><br/>

When you contribute liquidity to the ARGO/ETH Uniswap pool and stake your ARGO/ETH shares, you’ll be rewarded in $ARGO, while the same applies for Polygon network.

## 3. FAQs

<b>Q1. Why there is no reward for week 0?</b><br/>

Ans. We gave the week 0 for everyone to stake their tokens and get the whole thing started. So that everyone can start getting rewards starting from the end of week 1.<br/><br/>

<b>Q2. Is there a limit to the amount of ARGO tokens a single address can stake ?</b><br/>

Ans. There is no limit to the amount of tokens you can stake. <br/><br/>

<b>Q3. Is there any locking mechanism for the pools ?</b><br/>

Ans. There is no locking mechanism, you can unstake your tokens anytime and withdraw. Although the reward accumulated for that month will be nullified. <br/><br/>

<b>Q4. When can you harvest your reward ?</b><br/>

Ans. You can harvest your reward right after a month/epoch ends, and not during a month. <br/><br/>

<b>Q5. Can I withdraw my stake during a month and harvest the reward for the duration I was staked ?</b><br/>

Ans. No, You need to keep your stake throughout the month in order to get the rewards, mid epoch withdrawals will result in reward nullification. <br/><br/>

<b>Q6. Can someone stake at the end of the month and still get rewards for the whole month ?</b><br/>

Ans. No, the staking algorithm takes the time of deposit into account and adjusts the stake that will be considered in that epoch. The total stake will be accepted in the next month automatically.
For Eg - Roughly, If 15 days have passed in a month and someone stakes 100 tokens only 50 will be considered for that month and the full 100 tokens will be staked for the next month. <br/><br/>

<b>Q7. What does harvest do ?</b><br/>

Ans. Harvest transfers all the reward ARGO account into your wallet and keeps the staked ARGO in the pool only. <br/><br/>

<b>Q8. What does harvest and stake do ?</b><br/>

Ans. Harvest and stake in both pools (ARGO and ARGO_LP) deposits the rewarded ARGO into ARGO Pool, this enables you to compound your ARGO stake without wasting gas fees. <br/><br/>

<b>Q9. How can I transfer my ARGO from Ethereum or Polygon or vice-versa ?</b><br/>

Ans. The bridge is live on https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/ <br/><br/>
