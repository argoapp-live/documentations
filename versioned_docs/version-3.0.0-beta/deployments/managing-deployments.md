### Redeploy a Project

Spheron automatically redeploys your application to integrate new and existing changes. You update an application by editing, adding, or deleting its contents.

However, there can be situations (e.g. bad cached data) where you need to Redeploy your application to fix issues manually. 

<img src={require('@site/static/img/3.0.0/deploy-redeploy.png').default} />

Redeploy your previous deployment manually, by clicking on the redeploy button. 


You can check the configuration by clicking on the view configuration before redeploying the project using Spheron.
