<font size="4"> Continuous Deployment is now possible with Spheron directly from Github, users can now enable continuous deployment and every merge to the branch will trigger a new build and their website will be always updated with the latest changes. We have mitigated the hassle of manually deploying the website again and again. </font> <br/><br/>

<font size="4"> <b>Note: To use Continuous Deployment make sure you accept the updated Spheron Github app permissions. It is necessary for Continuous Deployment to work.</b> </font> <br/><br/>

<font size="4"> You can accept the update permissions by following these steps - </font> <br/>

1. Open https://github.com/apps/spheron-protocol/installations/new and open the GitHub Organizations where you configured the **Spheron Protocol GitHub App**
   <img src={require('@site/static/img/argoapplive-permission.png').default} />

2. Now you will see a permission request, just click **Review request** and accept the new permission.
