Spheron supports multiple decentralized protocols that you can use to deploy your app. Choose the protocol that best suits your needs. Currently, Spheron supports these 4 protocols. They are Arweave, Skynet, Filecoin, and Pinata.

Blockchain is widely used in decentralized data storage platforms to track storage transactions. Blockchain is a distributed ledger system that allows distant nodes to automatically synchronize and validate storage transactions.

Shard hashes, data locations, rental prices, and other transaction-specific information might be recorded in the blockchain ledger. Blockchain can also connect people in need of storage with servers who can provide it.

#### What advantages can decentralized storage networks offer?

Many advantages may be gained via decentralized storage networks. The key advantage of using a decentralized network for storage is cost savings. Decentralized storage networks serve as a middleman between people in need of storage and those with excess capacity that they are prepared to rent. As a result, such storage is usually affordable.

Decentralized storage networks are often built on the blockchain or comparable technologies, and can provide benefits including data immutability, increased privacy, and improved overall security. Because there is no single point of failure in storage, decentralized networks are more robust.

### Arweave

Arweave is a new sort of storage that backs data with long-term and eternal endowments, letting users and developers genuinely retain data forever. Arweave allows us to recall and store vital information, apps, and history permanently as a jointly owned hard drive that never forgets. It stops others from rewriting history by conserving it.

### Filecoin

Filecoin is an IPFS based decentralized network that allows for storing data accessible from virtually anywhere. Users can also offer their available storage as nodes on the network and earn Filecoin as data is stored and retrieved on those nodes.

### IPFS 

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a set of composable, peer-to-peer protocols for addressing, routing, and transferring content-addressed data in a decentralized file system
