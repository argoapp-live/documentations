## What is Bunzz?

Bunzz is a browser-integrated dApp development platform and functions like Firebase but for dApps
development, being a Blockchain Backend as a Service (BC BaaS) that lets developers create
dApps without coding but combining smart contracts by selecting Modules and after that integrating them to a front-end via a Bubble plug-in, while at the same time Bunzz provides the
automatic back-end solutions for them, all in one platform.

The platform allows users to complete the entire process from dApp configuration to deployment
using only a graphical user interface (GUI), thus greatly reducing the cost of learning blockchain
and smart contracts to build a dApp.

Bunzz provides an environment where you can use the main functions required for dApps, as well as
smart contracts that have been compiled and security audited in advance. In addition to development, deployment to the blockchain can be done from Bunzz, making it highly convenient for developers of Web3 services.

Bunzz simplifies the development of smart contracts that require advanced knowledge, allowing
developers to focus more on value-added work.

### Advantages of using Bunzz

1. The use of standardized smart contract modules prevents the reinvention of the wheel
   and significantly reduces the time and man-hours from idea conception to launch (e.g.,
   ERC20 generation, NFT Mint, and marketplace building can be developed with just a
   click).

2. Smart contracts are audited on the Bunzz side. No need to worry about security.

3. DApp can be built with zero technical understanding of solidity or blockchain, so even
   beginners can launch Web3-related services.

4. Deployable on major EVM-compatible chains (Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, BSC,
   Astar, etc.) as well as Ethereum (including Testnets)

5. Multiple smart contract modules can be linked together to build a multifunctional DApp
   (e.g., NFT Mint module and Marketplace module can be combined to develop a
   Mint-enabled NFT marketplace)

6. Linkage with existing external smart contracts (enabling a composable DApp
   development environment, to be implemented from 2022 Q3)

7. Smart contract developers can publish contract modules from the Bunzz repository
   function and monetize them (to be implemented from 2022 Q2)

### Introduction of Bunzz modules (some excerpts)

1. Combination of NFT generation module + NFT marketplace function module
   (Compatible with ERC721 and ERC1155. (Original contract)

2. NFT generation module that can be minted into IPFS (compatible with ERC721 and
   ERC1155. (Original contract)

3. ERC20 generation module

4. Combination of ERC20 generation module and ICO module

5. Vesting function module (function to lock tokens for a certain period of time) [to be
   implemented in 2022 Q2].

6. Staking function module (function to distribute interest according to the amount of tokens
   deposited) [to be implemented in 2022 Q2].

7. Vaulting function module (a function that locks tokens for a certain period of time and
   distributes interest based on the amount of tokens) [To be implemented in 2022 Q2].
