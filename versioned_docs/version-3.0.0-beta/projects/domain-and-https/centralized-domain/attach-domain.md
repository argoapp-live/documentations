Thanks to Spheron's <b>Automated DNS Resolver</b>, you won't have to change the records after every redeployment.

To enable it, select **Latest** from the deployed link options

## Verifying the Domain

The domain must be verified before it is linked to the site. After adding the domain, add the records shown in the domain item and click on verify. This will check the configuration in the DNS provider. We then must wait for the domain to be propagated before clicking on Verify DNS configuration.

To verify that the DNS is indeed propagated before clicking on the button, you can use a tool such as https://dnschecker.org/

If the verify dns was successfull, then verify button will not be shown anymore.
