## Regions

A local business would have no issue selecting the closest region to their store, but businesses with traffic spanning cities, countries, or even the entire globe might struggle to serve all their customers. A Typical server configuration might begin by selecting the region where the physical server is located. This is where the Spheronâ€™s Edge Network comes in.

## Outage Resiliency

If an Edge Region goes down, an application's traffic gets rerouted to another Edge Region. If all the regions are down for some region, you can still access your deployments from origin (IPFS or Arweave).

## Routing

The Spheron Platform acts as a Universal API and Overlay Network on top of existing cloud infrastructure providers.
