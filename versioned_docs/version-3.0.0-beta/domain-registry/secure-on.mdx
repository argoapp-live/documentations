## secureon

Secureon is a frontend validation tool powered by Spheron
At Secureon, we are building extensions to validate any Dapp. Due to the lack of security in accessing Dapps that handle millions of dollars of crypto, we are building validation tools for the community to validate and access only secured frontends.

We ensure users are only accession dapps deployed via Spheron and maintained or curated by verified entities or governance.
This extension validates the user interface by making sure the content serving on the UI is the same as deployed by the team.

With the help of an extension, users don't have to trust any email-based links, worry about domain hijacking, or fear a centralized domain getting down. Now, users will always have a decentralized version of the web apps they can open.
