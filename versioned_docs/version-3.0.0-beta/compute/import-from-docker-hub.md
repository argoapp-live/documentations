## Gettign Started from DockerHub 

The steps are followed from the getting started page of compute and branched into the following steps if chose to import the image from docker hub, this is a step-by-step guide to import from dockerhub. 

- Cluster name: Choose a descriptive name for your instance.
- Repository: Add the repository where you want the instance to be.
- Tag: Assign metadata to the instance for easier management and organization.

## H2 Select Instance 

- Storage: Compute instances typically come with either local (on-instance) or network attached storage options. Local storage is faster but is limited in size and is deleted when the instance is terminated. Network attached storage can be larger and persist after instance termination but can be slower to access.

- RAM: The amount of RAM an instance has determines how many tasks it can perform simultaneously and how quickly it can perform them. The more RAM, the more expensive the instance.

- CPU: The number and type of CPUs determine the processing power of an instance. The more CPUs and the faster they are, the more expensive the instance.

- Average Monthly Cost: The cost of a compute instance depends on the type and amount of resources it uses. The average monthly cost can range from a few dollars to hundreds or thousands of dollars for high-end instances.

- Average Daily Cost: The average daily cost is calculated by dividing the average monthly cost by 30. This cost can be affected by factors such as the instance's usage pattern, resource utilization, and any coupons applied.

*Note: The specific cost and resource information may vary depending on the cloud provider and region. It is recommended to check the provider's pricing documentation for up-to-date and accurate information.*

## H2 Additional Configuration 

You can also configure optional features like port policy mapping, adding envoirment varibale and advanced configuration as adding commands and argurments

### H3 Port Policy Mapping 

Port policy mapping is a feature of some cloud providers that enables you to control the access to the ports of your instances, by defining rules that specify which sources are allowed to access which ports. The main goal of port policy mapping is to improve the security of your instances by limiting the exposure to the network.For example, to allow incoming HTTP traffic from anywhere, you can add a rule that allows TCP traffic on port 80 from 0.0.0.0/0.

You can select port 80 or Random port mapped to the container port. 

To test the port policy mapping, you can use a tool such as Telnet or curl to try to connect to the port that you just opened. If the connection is successful, then the port policy mapping is working as expected.

### H3 Envoirment Variables 

Environment variables are values that can be passed to a compute environment  to configure its behavior. They can be set when the environment is started, and they can be used by the applications running in the environment to determine their behavior.

You can intiate by inserting `KEY` and `VALUE` pair to the instance. 

### H3 Advaced Configuration 

Custom commands and arguments are a way to pass specific instructions to a compute instance, such as a virtual machine, container, or cloud instance, at startup. This allows you to configure the instance in a specific way, or run specific scripts or applications when the instance starts.

You can add the following `CMD` instruction to a Dockerfile to specify the custom command and arguments which can be easily added to your instace. 

### H3 Heath Checkup 

To monitor the instance health, you can use the appropriate method for your compute instance. You can setup health checkup by setting up health check path and health check port.

The health path and port must be configured in a way that is accessible from the network in order for the monitoring to be effective. 

You can monitor the status of your instance creation on the "Instances" page. Once the instance has been created, you can start using it.

## H2 Final Deployment 

Once you have finished configuring your instance, click on the "Deploy" button. This will start the process of creating your instance. The instance will be deployed, it will reflect in progress and then deployed. 

### H3 Status and Logs

Stats represent Total, Active, Starting, Closed and Failed to Start instances. 

Instance logs and instance events refer to the log data generated by instances in a computing environment. This data can include information about the instance's system performance, resource utilization, and any events or errors that occur.

Deploy logs refer to the logs generated during the deployment process of an application or system. These logs typically include information about the deployment process, such as the steps taken, the status of each step, and any errors that occur.

The purpose of these logs is to provide insight into the operation and performance of cloud instances and deployments. They can be used for troubleshooting, performance analysis, and auditing purposes.

To access your instance, you can use Deployment URL or SSH. You can find the connection details for your instance in the Spheron instance dashboard.

### H3 Additional Stats 

The stats reflected on the instace dasboard are Instance ID, Instance Plan, Price(/day) and Refundable Amount.

Some **Creating an instance will immediately debit 5 AKT from your wallet. So you
must have 5 AKT and the amount needed to run the instance for at least
one day available.**(#).
