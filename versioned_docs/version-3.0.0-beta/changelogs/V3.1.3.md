## Introducing New Frameworks

<img src={require('@site/static/img/3.0.0/changelog/v3.1.3/header.png').default} />

We have successfully added six more frameworks to our framework list. Users can now quickly deploy their apps using these frameworks on Spheron. Here is the list of frameworks getting added:

- [Ionic React](https://ionicframework.com/)
- [Ionic Angular](https://ionicframework.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Scully](https://github.com/scullyio/scully)
- [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/)
- [Brunch](https://brunch.io/)

We have also implemented auto-detect for the framework. Any repo built with these frameworks will be automatically selected, and the configuration will be pre-filled during the deployment.

## Fixes ðŸ› 

We've shipped some bug fixes from your feedback to improve your product experience.

**Here are some of the recent ones.**

- **Deployment Command Trimming:** We have fixed the issue when the user mistakenly passes extra space in the command, which breaks the deployment. We now trim all the commands before passing them to the deployment task to start the deployment.
- **API Updates:** We have updated some endpoints and their functionality. Please check the swagger documentation for testing the changes.

  - Expanded the Response of API Key Scope to include User and Organization data.
  - Added support for choosing which git action the user wants to trigger during or after the deployment. Added extra fields in the deployment body to control the action.

  ```
  "gitProviderPreferences": {
     "prComments": true,
     "commitComments": true,
     "buildStatus": true,
     "githubDeployment": true
   }

  ```

  - Added support to use the domain name beside the domain id in the API requests to fetch the domain detail inside a project.
  - We optimized the logic to fetch Gitlab repositories from GitLab API.
  - Added the missing properties in the Swagger docs for the domains.

- **Invoice Issue:** We fixed the calculation of the bonus fees. The bonus fee was for the whole bonus package instead of the specified bonus.
- **Plan usage:** We fixed issues when updating plan usage. Also, we made the logic to update the usage more precisely.
- We fixed the issue with deployment environment activation. User can now activate their deployments if it's in the deactivated state.
- We added timeout status for our deployment in the UI. Our deployment timeout period is 30 mins. If deployment takes more than 30 mins, the platform automatically closes the deployment task which is trying to deploy the app.
