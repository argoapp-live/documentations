## Dedicated IPFS Gateway

We are introducing our dedicated IPFS gateway for all the PInata & Filecoin deployments. Your deployments on IPFS can now be accessed using our IPFS gateway - `spheron.infura-ipfs.io`. This will fix the recent outages of all the sites deployed on IPFS and using the Infura public IPFS gateway.

## Fixes ðŸ› 

We've shipped some bug fixes from your feedback to improve your product experience.

**Here are some of the recent ones**.

- **Redeploy Project:** We fixed the issue of not being able to change the protocol when redeploying your project.
