## Optimism Integration

<img src={require('@site/static/img/3.0.0/changelog/v3.2.1/header.png').default} />

We have introduced the **Optimism** chain for subscription payments. We have allowed four tokens - **USDT, USDC, DAI,** and **WETH** on the **Optimism** chain. All the user flow for upgrading to the PRO plan using **Optimism** is the same, but you can connect your metamask wallet and select the **Optimism** chain to upgrade to pro and buy bonuses.

## UX improvements

- **Repository filtering:** we have added support to filter and search your repositories directly from the server in Github, Gitlab & Bitbucket. This will provide better UX for users to search their repository without loading it in the UI first.

## Fixes ðŸ› 

- We have fixed the issue that would cause an organization not to have an active subscription.
- We have fixed a couple of bugs on our CDN.
- We have fixed the issue that didnâ€™t allow the cluster environment variables to have = character.
- We have fixed the issue that was causing the arweave deployment to fail on our Upload-API.
- We have fixed the issue causing the subscription usage not to update when deleting ENS and HNS domains.
