## Introducing Spheron Edge Network

<img src={require('@site/static/img/3.0.0/changelog/v3.0.7/header.jpg').default} />

We are launching our CDN infrastructure to serve websites hosted using Spheron. The Spheron Edge Network sits in between the internet and your deployments. The Spheron Edge Network has many responsibilities, but most importantly, it is responsible for routing requests to your Builds' correct Static File output.

The Spheron Edge Network caches your content at the edge to serve data to your users as quickly as possible. The Edge Network runs in dozens of locations worldwide to route requests as fast as possible. Static Files are always distributed across the whole network, thus not location-specific.

Aside from routing your requests to the correct destination, the Edge Network also takes care of a few other important aspects of a working **Deployment:**

- Terminating SSL
- Compressing your responses - Currently using gzip

The Edge Network supports the following protocols (negotiated with [ALPN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7301)):

- [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)
- [HTTP/1.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)
- [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2)

Upgrade your domains to the latest version to take advantage of the new Spheron Edge Network and supercharge your domains. To do that, go to your project domains, and click Upgrade. Once you upgrade it, you will see new records show up on the UI. Update your DNS with the latest records and click Verify. Once your domain got verified, it will start serving the deployment you attached to the domain.

**Here are some of the recent ones**.
